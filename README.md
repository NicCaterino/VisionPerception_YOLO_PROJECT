# VisionPerception_YOLO_PROJECT
This project is a pedestrian detection and direction prediction system that uses YOLO for object detection and box tracking and optical flow for direction prediction. The system is designed to be used in a car to help avoid collisions with pedestrians.

The system works by first detecting pedestrians in the live video feed using YOLO. Once the pedestrians are detected, their direction is predicted using box tracking or optical flow. The direction prediction is used to determine if the pedestrians are a collision risk. If the pedestrians are a collision risk, the system should alert the driver.

The system was able to successfully detect pedestrians and predict their direction in a variety of conditions. The results were promising, and the system could be used to help avoid collisions with pedestrians.

# Key Features
Uses YOLO for object detection Uses box tracking and optical flow for direction prediction Can be used in a car to help avoid collisions with pedestrians Was able to successfully detect pedestrians and predict their direction in a variety of conditions

# Future Work
There are a few areas where the project could be improved:

The accuracy of the direction prediction could be improved by using a more sophisticated optical flow algorithm. The system could be made more robust to noise and occlusion. The system could be extended to detect other objects to estimate car speed.
